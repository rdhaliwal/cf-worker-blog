Hello there!

This is my new blog type thing. I'm a front end developer that particularly enjoys playing around with CSS and messing around with React. I plan on using this blog as an outlet to document any interesting things I've learnt along the way, or share any experiments I end up concocting.

Hopefully you get something useful out of it!
